        "Body": "MONACO — With two laps to go, as his Ferrari sped out of the tunnel and into the daylight, Charles Leclerc was starting to tear up.\n\n“F— Charles, you cannot do that now. You still have two laps to finish.”\n\nThis was the grand prix he’d wanted to win since he was a child. These were the streets where he grew up. It was the race he’d watched from the family apartment, cheering on the red cars, wondering what it might be like to someday be the one out there racing — and winning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was the dream, and, after leading more than 70 laps from pole position, he was now within touching distance of realizing it.\n\nLeclerc knew what it felt like to come close to victory in Monaco, only to have it cruelly snatched away. His miserable record at home dated right back to his Formula Two days, when he retired from both races of the 2017 round that marked his home debut. A brake failure in 2018 was followed by a qualifying strategy error by Ferrari the following year, causing him to drop out in Q1.\n\nThen came the two F1 pole positions, in 2021 and 2022, neither of which resulted in victory. The first time it was due to crash damage sustained while pushing at the end of qualifying, which reared its head when trying to start the car ahead of the race and meant he could take zero part. 2022 was another Ferrari strategy fumble that led to Leclerc slipping from pole to P4. Last year, an outright lack of pace was compounded by a grid penalty, leaving him to finish sixth.\n\nSo many chances, so many misses.\n\nLeclerc said he thought of his father, who died in 2017, in the final laps. (Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty Images)\n\nIt meant the spotlight always shone brightest on Leclerc in Monaco. Each year he’d arrive and face questions about whether this was finally the year where he’d break the ‘curse’ at his home race and become the first homeborn winner since Louis Chiron in 1931. Would it ever come?\n\n“I never believed in the curse,” Leclerc said after the race. “However, it always felt very difficult on the two occasions I had to win here. As a driver, you never really know when will be the next opportunity to win, especially when it’s your home race — and even more so when your home race is Monaco, that is such a special track, such a difficult track and weekend to master and do everything perfectly.\n\n“I knew that today was another opportunity. I knew how it felt the last two times I was in this position.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe would not let it slip away again.\n\nLeclerc had been taking the inevitable pressure that came with his home race weekend in his stride. Practice and qualifying went to plan, building up the pace well and taking the all-important pole position. But then the race threw a curveball: an early red flag and restart reduced the grand prix to a race of tire management where everyone had to slow their pace at the front and save enough tire life to get to the end.\n\nLeclerc remained cool throughout. He never looked at real risk of losing, despite having Oscar Piastri filling his mirrors for the majority of the race as they lapped some 10 seconds off the optimal qualifying pace of the cars in Monaco at times. It was always under control.\n\nThe pace upped a little in the closing stages as the fuel dropped, allowing Leclerc to peel ahead. Piastri knew the race was long lost, his own brief attempt to show his nose for an overtake the early stages being rebuffed. And Leclerc knew what was about to happen. At long last, he was about to win his home race in Monaco. It didn’t really matter how he did it. Everything was in hand.\n\nThen came the emotions.\n\nLeclerc started experiencing something that had never happened before in his racing career. Memories of his journey to this point started flashing through his mind. The career that had started in go-karting, led him onto the single-seater racing ladder and all the way up to F1. Then to race with its most iconic team, Ferrari, driving its famed red cars in those famed red overalls.\n\nHe thought of his family and friends, who were dotted all around the track willing him on with every single flash of his red Ferrari that flew past. Their love and support, everything they’d given for him to get to this point.\n\nBut at the forefront of Leclerc’s mind was his father, Hervé. The man who brought him up to be who he is today. Who sacrificed so much to make his racing dream a reality.\n\nHervé never got the chance to see his son race in the Monaco Grand Prix, the race that would always be the highlight of their calendar years. He died in 2017, one year before Leclerc reached F1.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Charles Leclerc (@charles_leclerc)\n\n\n\nShortly before his father passed, Leclerc told him a white lie: that he’d signed an F1 contract for the following year. He hadn’t. But he would a few months later, graduating to F1 with Sauber in 2018 before getting the dream move to Ferrari one year later.\n\nMonaco was the race that they watched together and dreamed together of Charles winning someday. It meant as the laps ticked down, and the enormity of the achievement got ever closer with every corner, every steering input and gear change as he threaded his car through the barriers, Leclerc became more emotional.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“In every race I have done, there has not been one single race where I was thinking about this kind of personal stuff inside the car, because you’ve got to stay on it,” Leclerc said. “You’ve got these flashbacks of all these moments that we have spent together, all the sacrifices that he has done for me to get to where I am.”\n\nThey were emotions that Leclerc admitted he found difficult to manage. The closest he’d come to a similar feeling was at Baku in 2017, when he raced in F2 just days after his father’s passing, the raw grief so fresh in his mind. He went and won with a dominant display.\n\nBut victory in Monaco was always the dream for Charles and Hervé. This was so much more than just another race, another 25 points and another trophy for the cabinet. If he was going to win anywhere, it had to be in Monaco.\n\nLeclerc fulfilled a childhood dream on Sunday – for himself and his father. (Peter Fox – Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\n\nAs Leclerc crossed the line, he punched the air and let it all out. “Finally!” came the cry of his race engineer, Bryan Bozzi. Leclerc screamed and yelled inside his helmet, cursing as he flipped from Italian to English to French through his celebrations before letting out a quieter, exasperated “finally.”\n\nFinally he’d done it. He’d emulated the heroes he’d watched tapes of growing up, like Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher, by winning in Monaco, adding his name to the who’s who of greats that have scored victory around these famed streets.\n\n“Monaco is the grand prix that made me dream of becoming an F1 driver with my father, (who) has done absolutely everything for me to get to where I am today,” Leclerc said.\n\n“I feel like I didn’t only accomplish a dream of mine today, but also one of his.”\n\nHas any other Monaco Grand Prix winner ever had such a charge of emotion when doing so? The jubilation and prestige of the moment, yes. An invite to dinner with the prince at the palace, of course. But to Charles Leclerc, this all meant more. So much more than a normal F1 win.\n\nThis was for him and his dad.\n\n(Lead photo of Charles Leclerc: Bryn Lennon – Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)",

        "Body": "Robert Triggs / Android Authority Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\nTL;DR The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra’s camera specs have apparently leaked online.\n\nSamsung’s Ultra phone could get a 50MP 3x camera and a 50MP ultrawide lens.\n\nThe phone could stick with a 200MP main camera and 50MP 5x shooter, though.\n\nWe’ve already seen several Galaxy S25 series leaks in the last few months, even though the phones are only expected to launch in January 2025. We most recently heard rumors about the S25 Ultra camera setup, and now another tipster has dished out details.\n\nLeaker Ice Universe claimed on Weibo that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will still feature a quad rear camera system. This comes after two other leakers asserted that Samsung could switch to a triple-camera system — a claim that was refuted by Ice Universe at the time.\n\nIn any event, the tipster says the Galaxy S25 Ultra will retain a 200MP main camera and a 50MP 5x camera. However, it looks like upgrades are coming to the ultrawide sensor and 3x camera. More specifically, Ice Universe alleges that the phone will pack a 50MP ultrawide camera and a 50MP 3x shooter.\n\nThe upgraded 3x camera would be a long-overdue move, as Samsung has stuck with a small, 10MP 3x sensor since 2021’s Galaxy S21 Ultra. A high-resolution telephoto camera would allow Samsung to use pixel-binning on this tele lens, potentially improving 3x and portrait snaps in low light. The increased megapixel count would also be helpful for hybrid zoom, improving image quality between 3x and 5x. We’ve also seen some phones use the tele lens for macro shots, so a high-resolution 3x shooter with macro support could deliver detailed close-up snaps.\n\nMeanwhile, a 50MP ultrawide camera would also bring Samsung’s Ultra phone in line with the best camera phones. Devices like the Google Pixel 8 Pro and Xiaomi 14 series offer high-resolution ultrawide cameras too, using pixel-binning for better low-light snaps. This could also theoretically enable 8K ultrawide recording.\n\nThis latest leak might disappoint some people who were hoping for a more ambitious camera zoom upgrade, though. Two leakers claimed earlier this month that the S25 Ultra would get a 50MP variable telephoto camera, capable of shooting at ~4x or ~7x.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

        "Body": "If Memorial Day weekend is the unofficial start of summer on most Americans’ calendars, then it makes sense that the real tentpole kicking off tent season for a lot of people is not “Furiosa” or “Garfield” but “The Beach Boys,” a streaming documentary devoted to the least wintery group of all time.\n\nThe Disney+ film, co-directed by music-doc stalwarts Frank Marshall and Thom Zimny, focuses on the first decade and a half, in the 1960s and ’70s, of the career of the rock band that still might rightfully be considered America’s greatest all-time group. It starts with their unusual, pre-Beatles melding of complex Four Freshmen harmonies with surf music and themes; continues on through the ground-breaking work of the “Pet Sounds” era that led to a friendly rivalry with the Beatles; covers the complicated years when musical architect Brian Wilson physically and psychologically retreated, leaving the group to seek out new identities during the counterculture years; and finally, their comeback in the mid-’70s when the “Endless Summer” best-of created a fresh wave of Boys-band mania.\n\nShould it be at least an hour longer, and probably a lot more than that? Undoubtedly, if you’re a fan. But in an era of everything in the culture feeling like an extended deluxe edition, there will also be much gratitude for the skill with which Marshall and Zimny hit the key points in a doc that, true to the SoCal-based subject at hand, can honestly and admiringly be characterized as “breezy.” It’s a very efficient safari. (In his review, Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman writes: “I wondered how, exactly, the movie was going to pack the Beach Boys’ vast career into an hour and 53 minutes. But in its unabashedly conventional and fan-friendly way, it brings this off with a tasteful clarity and showmanship. In moment after moment, it gets the Beach Boys.”)\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nVariety had a conversation with original members Mike Love and Al Jardine (pictured above, left and right), along with Marshall (ccenter), just prior to the premiere. They talked about the documentary, plus a hefty new book, “The Beach Boys by the Beach Boys,” that covers the same ground in greater (600-page) detail. Meanwhile, Love’s touring edition of the Beach Boys (which includes one other near-original member, Bruce Johnston) will be back on home turf later this summer; the group plays the Greek on Aug. 30.\n\nWhat the instigation of this project? Because there have been, in the far distant past, a Beach Boys mini-series and some documentaries, but we’re talking like the ‘80s or 2000 for the last time we saw anything significant. Was there a desire to say, we need to have a really definitive documentary, and a timely one?\n\nMarshall: No, I think it was kind of my fault, that Thom Zimny and I were sitting around after we did Johnny Cash [“The Gift: The Journey of Johnny Cash,” which they also co-directed, released in 2019] and talking about what musical doc would we like to do together next. He started talking about the Beach Boys, and I said, “Well, I grew up in Newport, yeah, I love them.” And then as life does, things change; he did something else, I did something else. [When not directing music docs like “The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart,” Marshall is a producer of major Hollywood and Broadway projects.] But we still kept at it.\n\nBut the problem was that the Beach Boys were not one unit. If you went to get the rights or approvals on everything, it would’ve taken forever. But then Irving Azoff and Iconic Artists brought them all together — one-stop shopping — and then I said, “I know Irving. I’m going in.” And that’s how it happened.\n\nLove: We owe a lot of gratitude to Irving and to Frank for picking up the gauntlet.\n\nMarshall: And now there’s a book, and everything’s coming together to celebrate this music that’s had such an impact on the world for so many years.\n\nLove: Genesis, they make some beautiful books, and they did one for us [“The Beach Boys by the Beach Boys”] and it’s amazing.\n\nIt’s literally the heaviest book I own.\n\nLove: The big one is, like, literally 11 pounds. I weighed it with my little weighing thing because, you know, if you go on Southwest Airlines, you can only have 50 pounds.\n\nJardine: Only Mike would know. He wants to read about himself.\n\nLooking at the book, there are thousands of pictures, which would lead somone to believe the archives are really well-kept. Was that the same case with film clips for the doc, or were there any hurdles to overcome?\n\nMarshall: No, it’s always a challenge because, first of all, there have been so many articles, books, movies, and I always try to find stuff that’s never been seen before. But once I got to know everybodyand say, “Have you got any home movies under (the bed)?” And sure enough, there’d be a shoebox with 8mm film, and that’s how we got Dennis. Both Carl and Dennis’s families were great in helping us represent their dad and their husband in the right way. So it was like a little treasure hunt where there’s gold bullions every once in a while.\n\nLove: I think it’s wonderful that everybody was represented. Glen Campbell was in the group for a while. David Marks was in the group for a while, right at the beginning. Blondie (Chaplin)and Ricky (Fataar)from South Africa were in our group for a while. So it’s really been nice to see that everybody’s talents and contributions were recognized.\n\nIt’s easy to forget, until this film reminds you, that Glen Campbell was briefly in the group, before he had to take off and got replaced by Bruce Johnston.\n\nJardine: Glen had a burgeoning career about ready to happen, so he had to leave the band early. I think he only did one summer with us while Brian was out of action. And then I think you (Love) found Bruce…\n\nLove: We called 12 people to find somebody who could play bass. Bruce could sing high, but he didn’t play bass and we needed the bass player, so he said, “Oh, I play bass.” And he went and learned it, you know…\n\nJardine: …on the way to the airport…\n\nLove: Kind of!\n\nMike Love and Al Jardine of the Beach Boys (left and right) and director-producer Frank Marshall (center)\n\nIs there anything that you dug up archivally that was a little bit surprising, or just that you hadn’t seen in a long time, that you’re kind of delighted is in the documentary?\n\nLove: Well, I hadn’t seen certain people’s home movies. Why would I have, you know? The Wilson stuff, yes, the Love stuff, yes. But the Jardines, the Marks, the other people involved…\n\nJardine: How about the photo of Bruce and Keith Moon? Those are the ones I went, “I can’t believe that.” And you know, nobody knows that story, really.\n\nLove: Derek Taylor, the Beatles’ publicist who came to America and became our publicist, actually set up Bruce with about 15 interviews in England and introduced him to Keith Moon, who introduced Bruce to Paul McCartney and John Lennon. They were in Bruce’s suite, and Bruce was able to play them the “Pet Sounds” album before it even came out in Great Britain, and they played it through twice. So those guys became our promotion men.\n\nThe Beatles/Beach Boys “rivarly” circa 1966 has been talked about so much over the years, but someone in the film makes the statement that it wasn’t a rivalry so much as a collaboration, in a way.\n\nJardine: It was a mutual adoration, I think. And they inspired each other, because I don’t think we’d have “Sgt. Pepper’s” without “Pet Sounds,” and I don’t think we’d have “Pet Sounds” without “Rubber Soul.”\n\nFrank, you said that growing up in Newport helped your love of the Beach Boys develop in the early ‘60s. Can you talk about what your first point of connection was?\n\nMarshall: Well, my dad was a guitarist [noted jazz guitarist and TV/film composer Jack Marshall], and we played guitar a lot at home with him. But I also grew up as a surfer, so we did “The Surfer Stomp” at the Rendezvous Ballroom [on the Balboa beach in Orange County]. But all the music was instrumental; it was the Ventures or Dick Dale. Then suddenly there were lyrics and harmonies, and I was keenly interested because my dad was so sophisticated with his music, and also at Capitol Records [the label that both the Bach Boys and Jack Marshall were signed to]. And I thought, “Wow, they’re writing about this lifestyle and this culture” — which was very small at the time; surfing was very small — “but they put words to it.” And that just exploded out, because people started thinking: That’s what I want to do. It created a lifestyle that people envied and wanted to be a part of, and it was music that made people feel good and want to come to sunny Southern California.\n\nOf course it’s part of the Beach Boys’ legend that Dennis Wilson was the only real surfer in the group. In those first years, Mike and Al, did either of you guys think, gosh, may, maybe we need to try a little harder to do this, just so we fit in and actually live the lifestyle we’re singing about?\n\nLove: Well, a couple of the guys never surfed at all. A few of us tried to do it. But it’s harder than Chinese arithmetic. I mean, it really is. So I really appreciate the fact that those guys would get up and before class go surfing and then go to school and then after school they’d surf until it got dark. That was a way of life. [He quotes the lyrics to “Surfin’,” from 1962.] “Surfing is the only life, the only way for me now, now surf, surf [claps hands] with me.”\n\nJardine: I used to take Dennis to the beach to go surfing. I had an old ‘49 or ’50 Ford, and he needed wheels. So we went down to El Porto in Manhattan Beach, and he taught me how not to surf. I hit the sand straight, the very first wave, right down to the bottom. That was probably my last experience. He was a natural athlete. He knew how to do it. And he wrote the story on surfing.\n\nLove: Well, we may not have been great surfers, but we sang about it really well.\n\nTo ask about the interviews that were done for the film: Beyond the Beach Boys themselves, past and present, there’s just a very small list of people who you got for this. It’s a very tight film, so it’s for the best that you didn’t go out and interview 50 talking heads for it. You’ve got Marilyn, Brian’s first wife, who may be better to represent his feelings from back in the day that he could at this point…\n\nMarshall: Yeah, she did. Good job, too.\n\nHow did that selection process go, picking interview subjects?\n\nMarshall: One of the things that I love about documentaries is the freedom. You know, in my day job [producing dramatic feature films], I get a script and I know exactly where I am all the time. But it’s a team effort. I have archivists and I put it out there: OK, who’s talked about being influenced and inspired by the Beach Boys’ music? And then I’d have to narrow ’em down depending on where they were (growing up) — you know, Don Was was in Detroit, and Janelle Monae was in Kansas City, and Ryan Tedeer was in Oklahoma, and he wanted to go someplace where it was warm. So they had different areas of influence, but they recognized the power and how brilliant the music was. So Thom and I split it up. Thom did a lot of the audio interviews, and then I came in with the camera and did the on-camera stuff.\n\nWith Brian, it was a useful workaround to have some good archival interviews as well as the little bit you have of him in the present day. Anyone who has interviewed him in recent years knows he is not loquacious, and the diagnosis that recently went public helps explain why he’s a man of fewer words.\n\nLove: Yeah. But for the end of the film, he was great. We sang together. We talked together. He was 100% present with the long-term memory and everything. He’s just not physically as well as he could be, and he does need help and supervision, particularly health-wise, and it’s challengng. But he was remembering stuff from our childhood and teenage years that I had forgotten, actually, and so we could sing together. We sang “Their Hearts Were Full of Spring.” We sang “Fun, Fun, Fun.” Sang “Surfin’ Safari” together. All that was fantastic.\n\nMarshall: And that was kind of my dream come true. I had always wished as we were going along: Maybe I can get ’em together. And what a perfect spot, where the first album (cover was shot). But it wasn’t an interview. So Brian was able to just be himself, with the guys he spent 60 years with, and it was like a family reunion, laughing, crying, singing, telling stories. It was incredible. There wasn’t the pressure of “Tell me about when you did this or that.” So that was part of what made it special.\n\nJardine: Exactly. He doesn’t forget lyrics. We go way back and we’ll do songs like the stuff we did out at Paradise Cove. He remembers everything, just like that. The current stuff, not so much. But he’s got musical integrity, let’s put it that way.\n\nMarshall: But you’re right about the interview. It was difficult.\n\nWhen did you film the bit at the end with everyone together on the beach?\n\nMarshall: In September.\n\nJardine: Maybe we’ll hear some more about it in part two.\n\nIs there a story you wanted to tell with this film, where in any way you feel like the Beach Boys’ story isn’t totally understood? Some of us are a part of friend groups where it might be a natural thing to talk about the Beach Boys in any given week, but not the whole world is like that.\n\nLove: I think that everybody doesn’t know the Beach Boys’ story, because it hasn’t been told comprehensively enough, giving enough attribution to various individual members and experiences. At one time we had two jets on tour, the non-smoking jet and the smoking jet, going on tour. Alan and I, along with Bruce, were on the non-smoking, and the Wilson boys were on the smoking, and that may be a euphemism for certain lifestyle choices. So, I mean, there was division, there was a schism, and all that stuff. But when it came time to get on stage together or get around the microphone together, then all those things disappeared. And what manifested was that harmony and that blend and that sound that’s known around the world.\n\nMarshall: And I think one of the keys was that Brian didn’t like touring and came back here (to L.A.) and was just able to create, with none of the pressures of touring, and then their touring energy would come back and sing these parts, and that’s something that no other group did.\n\nLove: There’s a huge amount of information, from pre-group to early group to Brian leaving, and then the two groups, the recording group and the touring group, and then the different changes and…\n\nMarshall: You know, they’ve adapted at every turn. But then, you know, losing Carl and Dennis, it was a different sound.\n\nLove: So when people ask me, how do you feel (watching it)? I felt nostalgic, and I felt sad that a couple of the guys aren’t with us.\n\nFrank, you end the film essentially in the mid-‘70s, after the comeback with the “Endless Summer” greatest-hits album… followed by an epilogue in 1980 with the Washington, D.C. show. It ends before anyone dies, before “Kokomo,” before other controversies or reunions. Was there a reason structurally or for anything else that you put that particular time frame on the film? Of course it would’ve taken at least another hour to bring it anywhere near the present.\n\nMarshall: Yeah. I wanted to celebrate “America’s band,” to be honest. And that was, in my opinion, one of their greatest performances, with 400,000 people in Washington, D.C. (at the National Mall). It was one of the best recorded performances we had, and they were all there, reunited, so I just felt, “That’s the way to go out.” It was kind of poetic, I thought.",

        "Body": "CNN —\n\nAfter intense and deadly storms ravaged a large swath of the central United States over the weekend, Memorial Day weather woes will continue Monday – but with the diminished threat for extreme impacts this time around.\n\nPowerful storms and suspected tornadoes were responsible for at least 19 deaths – including four children – when severe storms hit several states including Kentucky, Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma over the weekend.\n\nImages of the aftermath showed piles of rubble, damaged cars and destroyed buildings. Severe wind and rain downed trees and power lines, knocking out power for more than 600,000 people across 12 states. The storms also delayed the 108th running of the Indianapolis 500 by about four hours on Sunday afternoon.\n\nLIVE UPDATES: At least 19 killed in tornado-spawning storms sweeping central US\n\nHarsh storms continued to pummel parts of Kentucky overnight and inflict damage on some communities, prompting Gov. Andy Beshear to issue a state of emergency early Monday. Phone lines in the Bowling Green area were knocked out, leading police to set up alternate emergency numbers for those who needed help.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Paducah is sending out at least two storm survey teams Monday to assess damage, the office said.\n\nTwo storm-related deaths have been reported in the state – one in Mercer County and one about 70 miles away in Louisville. Some relief is in store as the storm system moves east Monday, as its more violent and extreme impacts are expected to subside.\n\nOn Monday, heavy rain is expected to soak parts of the East Coast, and while the chance of tornadoes is much smaller than what unfolded over the weekend, there is still a possibility of isolated tornadoes along the Interstate 95 corridor from Newark, New Jersey, down to the Carolinas.\n\nSome major East Coast cities also face threats from damaging winds. Meanwhile, excessive heat will bake parts of the South with possibly record-breaking high temperatures as the unofficial start of summer gets underway.\n\nBy Tuesday evening, the storm front will shift into the Eastern Seaboard, according to the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center.\n\n“The boundary will create an area of showers and severe thunderstorms over parts of eastern Missouri and the Ohio Valley,” the center said.\n\nThere is a level 3 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms for those areas as well as the Tennessee Valley through Monday morning, with associated hazards including frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail and a few tornadoes.\n\n“There will be an added threat of EF2 to EF5 tornadoes and hail 2 inches or greater over parts of the Lower Mississippi/Western Tennessee Valleys,” according to the Storm Prediction Center.\n\nAreas within the Upper Mississippi Valley and Upper Great Lakes, including parts of Wisconsin, also face threats from localized flash flooding due to heavy rain through Monday morning.\n\nDownpours will also threaten Memorial Day plans along the Mid-Atlantic and into the Northeast. There is a level 2 of 4 slight risk of excessive rainfall over those regions from Monday through Tuesday morning, with flash flooding in low-lying and urban areas possible.\n\nCNN Weather\n\nHigh temperatures to scorch parts of the South\n\nHigh temperatures and an early season heat wave are expected to make for a sweltering Memorial Day holiday across parts of the south including southern Texas, the central Gulf Coast and southern Florida.\n\nSouth Texas is under an excessive heat warning through Monday evening and more heat warnings and advisories are expected to be issued across the South.\n\nHouston; New Orleans; Miami; Mobile, Alabama; Tampa, Florida; and Charleston, South Carolina, are some areas that could experience extreme warmth on Monday.\n\nTemperatures in some locations will be at or near-record highs, with heat index readings possibly exceeding 115 degrees, the center noted. The heat index – a measure of how the body actually feels when it’s hot out – is forecast to reach around 110 degrees on Monday in Houston and 119 degrees in Laredo, according to the city’s National Weather Service office.\n\nNightfall may not bring relief in some areas. Overnight low temperature are expected to be 10 to 15 degrees above normal.\n\nSuch extreme, prolonged heat raises the risk of heat illness such as heat stroke, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, adults with underlying health conditions, pregnant women and outdoor workers.\n\nThe risks of excessive heat – the most deadly form of extreme weather – are becoming more widespread as human-driven climate change drives warming global temperatures. During the warm season last year, heat-related illnesses accounted for a 20% larger share of emergency department visits than they did in the five previous seasons.\n\nCNN meteorologist Elliana Hebert and CNN’s Joe Sutton contributed to this report.",

        "Body": "Recent rumors have held that Apple will be allowing chatbots to integrate more deeply into its operating systems, and it seems that OpenAI is getting the first crack at that with ChatGPT. But Apple is still working on an agreement with Google to do the same with Gemini, according to Gurman. It’s also been rumored to be talking to Anthropic. (Those talks started before OpenAI’s ongoing Scarlett Johansson dust-up, but they underscore why Apple might want more than one iPhone chatbot deal.) Outside of whatever those potential partnerships will mean, Apple’s approach to AI will apparently focus on being practical.\n\nOne big, noticeable improvement Apple will reportedly announce could be a “smart recap” feature that Gurman mentions. This will apparently summarize missed texts, notifications, and other things like “web pages, news articles, documents, notes and other forms of media.” That might be particularly nice when it comes to dealing with iOS notifications, which can be overwhelming and difficult to tame. And if you squint, it vaguely echoes Microsoft’s recently-announced Recall feature that lets you look back at what you’ve been doing on your computer.\n\nThe Voice Memo app could also get a big boost in AI-generated transcripts, Gurman writes. Selfishly, that will be key for referring to interview recordings, but it could also be handy for, say, students recording their lessons for later reference. Apple devices have similar features already, like auto-generated voicemail transcripts and system-wide captions for videos, audio, and conversations.\n\nThe company also reportedly plans to announce AI-powered improvements to on-device Spotlight search, internet searches with Safari, as well as writing suggestions for emails and texts. And the company may also use AI to retouch photos and generate emoji on the fly, based on what you’re texting — a type of feature that seems to consistently lead to trouble for these companies. (See Meta’s gun-toting Waluigi AI stickers or Google’s inappropriately racially diverse nazi pictures.)\n\nApple could showcase a better, more natural-sounding voice for Siri, based on Apple’s own large language models, as well as better Siri functionality on the Apple Watch. Where it can, Apple’s devices will do all of this stuff locally, but for complicated tasks, they’ll offload processing to Apple’s own M2 Ultra-based servers, Gurman writes. In general, he says devices “released in the last year or so” will gain most of the new on-device AI features.\n\nApart from AI features, the company may announce an iOS 18 feature to let users change their app icons to different colors, according to Gurman. Something similar is possible now, using the iOS Shortcuts app, but I’d sure welcome a more straightforward method. That’s in addition to the other upcoming rumored iPhone home screen change will finally let users put app icons wherever they’d like instead of iOS forcing a top-to-bottom, left-to-right arrangement. What’s next? Custom launchers?",

        "Body": "CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — South Africans will vote Wednesday to decide whether their country will take its most significant political step since the moment 30 years ago when it brought down apartheid and achieved democracy.\n\nThis national election will not be as momentous as the one South Africa held in 1994 — few have been. Then, Nelson Mandela led the African National Congress party to victory as Black South Africans who were the majority were allowed to vote for the first time. It officially ended a half-century of racial segregation under apartheid — a violently enforced system that attracted the world’s outrage — and hundreds of years of white minority rule.\n\nBut while the ANC still governs in 2024, it is amid rising discontent caused largely by high levels of unemployment and poverty. That could result in a majority of South Africans choosing another party this week over the one that led them to freedom.\n\n“Thirty years of South African democracy does not mean we should endure an eternity under the ANC,” John Steenhuisen, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Alliance party, said in the run-up to the election.\n\nAny change is not expected to be sweeping, though.\n\nThe possible repercussions are complex because while several polls have the ANC’s support at less than 50%, suggesting it is in danger of losing its majority for the first time, no opposition party has risen to a position to overtake it. The ANC is still widely expected to be the largest party, well ahead of an increasing number of opposition movements that are splitting the disaffected vote.\n\nBut without an outright majority, the ANC would likely have to strike agreements or coalitions with others to remain in government and reelect President Cyril Ramaphosa. That would end its political dominance of post-apartheid South Africa and herald a new era, where the ANC co-governs.\n\nThe ANC won six successive national elections, starting with the one that made Mandela the first Black president in 1994. But from a high of gaining nearly 70% of the vote 20 years ago, it has experienced a steady decline in support while South Africa grapples with deep socio-economic problems, some of which were left over from apartheid.\n\nThe ANC has also been criticized for the corruption scandals that have plagued it and for not tackling the country’s violent crime problem. There were an average of 83 homicides a day in the last three months of 2023. A failure in basic government services impacts many in the country of 62 million, with communities, towns and parts of major cities going without water and electricity.\n\nThe issue that stands out, though, is joblessness and the resulting poverty. South Africa’s official unemployment rate is ranked the world’s worst at 32%, and it’s even higher — at 45% — for young people aged between 15 and 34. That sits at odds with the country’s status as the most advanced on the African continent. The World Bank estimates more than half of South Africans live below the poverty line.\n\n“Together we will do more and we will do better,” ANC leader Ramaphosa said in what’s almost become a party motto. At the ANC’s last major rally this weekend, he said it still represents the aspirations of South Africa’s people and promised to prioritize job programs and extend social support for the millions that rely on government grants.\n\nThe ANC asserts it is the only party that can effectively govern South Africa and while it’s undoubtedly facing its biggest electoral challenge, analysts point out that it has the most effective grass-roots campaigning machine and has traditional support among older South Africans and those in rural areas, voices that are generally given less airtime. The possibility of the ANC clinging onto its majority has not been ruled out.\n\nThe election will take place on one day, with nearly 28 million people registered to vote across the nation’s nine provinces. They will decide the makeup of the national Parliament but also the provincial legislatures. More than 50 parties are registered to contest the national election, a record number, and independent candidates have been allowed to stand for the first time.\n\nSouth Africans don’t vote directly for their president, but rather for parties. Those parties get seats in Parliament according to their share of the national vote and lawmakers elect the president, who has always been from the ANC because of its parliamentary majority.\n\nJust over 80% of South Africans are Black, but it’s a multiracial country, with significant numbers of people who are white, of Indian heritage or with biracial ethnicity. Mandela referred to South Africa as a “Rainbow Nation” as he attempted to harness that diversity into a new unity after apartheid.\n\nBut three decades later, poverty still disproportionately affects the Black majority. While they disagree strongly on policy and are in no way united, the main opposition parties, from the centrist DA to the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters and the new MK Party of former President Jacob Zuma, repeat one theme: that the ANC has failed to live up to its 1994 promise, when it swept to victory under the slogan “A Better Life For All.”\n\nThe ANC’s fading allure may be seen most clearly among young people, the South Africans in that 15-34 age bracket who didn’t experience apartheid or have no memory of it and many of whom are now voters. This election could give voice to a new generation, who are aware of apartheid and the ANC’s role in defeating it through stories told by their parents and grandparents but don’t see how it helps them three decades later.\n\n“The youth were not born, so we can’t tell them about fighting for freedom,” said Simphiwe Mpungose, a provincial organizer with the new MK Party. “They are concerned about what they see now.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Mogomotsi Magome in Johannesburg and Farai Mutsaka in Durban, South Africa, contributed.\n\n___\n\nAP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

Seven people were killed in northern Texas, eight in Arkansas, two in Oklahoma and one in Kentucky. Scores more were injured, and almost 500,000 were without electricity across several states on Sunday. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said more than a third of all counties in his state were now subject to a disaster declaration. Sheriff Ray Sappington of Cooke County, Texas, said the death toll there included two children aged two and five and three members of the same family. \"It's just a trail of debris left,\" said the sheriff of Valley View area, which was among those hardest hit by a powerful tornado. \"The devastation is pretty severe.\" Footage from the county showed a petrol station and rest stop almost completely destroyed, with twisted metal littered over damaged vehicles.

In Oklahoma, two people were killed in Mayes County and six others injured, the local emergency management authority told the BBC. Arkansas officials said a 26-year-old woman was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, while another of the four deaths in the state was reported in Benton County. The state also reported multiple people injured. Police officials in the city of Rogers, Arkansas, said they had rescued several people who were trapped after a tornado downed trees and power lines, and damaged gas supply lines.

        "Body": "Two new surveys suggest a troubling trend: Young adults seem to be slacking on sun safety.\n\nIn an online survey of more than 1,000 people published this month by the American Academy of Dermatology, 28 percent of 18- to 26-year-olds said they didn’t believe suntans caused skin cancer. And 37 percent said they wore sunscreen only when others nagged them about it.\n\nIn another poll, published this month by Orlando Health Cancer Institute, 14 percent of adults under 35 believed the myth that wearing sunscreen every day is more harmful than direct sun exposure. While the surveys are too small to capture the behaviors of all young adults, doctors said they’ve noticed these knowledge gaps and riskier behaviors anecdotally among their younger patients, too.\n\nTo some extent, experts said, this issue isn’t unique to the current generation of young adults. “There’s a component of young people just being young people,” said Dr. Melissa Shive, a dermatologist at UCI Health in Irvine, Calif. One survey conducted between 1986 and 1996 found that then-18- to 24-year-olds (who are now middle-aged) were more likely than older adults to visit tanning booths and get sunburns.\n\nYoung adults are often unaware of what sun damage looks like and how best to prevent it, Dr. Shive said. She said she recently saw a young patient who didn’t know tan skin and freckles were signs of sun damage. Dr. Heather Rogers, a clinical assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Washington, said more of her young patients now report visiting tanning beds. Ultraviolet rays — whether from tanning beds or direct sunlight — can damage skin and cause skin cancer, which can be deadly.",

From them, Dr Flannery and his team discovered evidence of three species previously unknown to science, findings which were published in Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology on Monday.\n\nThe critters had combinations of features never seen before - in living or fossil monotremes, said Director of the Australian Museum Research Institute Professor Kris Helgen, who also worked on the paper.\n\n\"[The Opalios splendens's] overall anatomy is probably quite like the platypus, but with features of the jaw and snout a bit more like an echidna,\" Prof Helgen said.\n\nAll opal fossils are rare - monotreme ones even more so - but these specimens are \"a revelation\", says Ms Smith.\n\nThey take the total number of monotreme species known to have once lived at Lightning Ridge - which was in ancient times a cold, wet forest bordering a vast inland sea - to six.\n\n\"They show the world that long before Australia became the land of pouched mammals, marsupials, this was a land of furry egg-layers - monotremes,\" Ms Smith says.\n\n\"It seems that 100 million years ago, there were more monotremes at Lightning Ridge than anywhere else on earth, past or present.\"\n\nOther experts say it is too early to say whether Australia once hosted a multitude of monotremes and that further exploration is needed.\n\n\"It may have been at least as diverse as the later Australian marsupial fauna... but I would need more evidence,\" Flinders University palaeontologist Rod Wells told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nThe study's authors hope their paper will encourage more funding for more targeted digs in the region, to support their findings.",

Right now it's not clear how many smartwatch models we'll get, because there's been talk of a high-end Ultra model and a cheaper FE edition too.\n\nIf Samsung still has room at the event, there's an outside chance we might also see the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 tablet series too, but that's less likely – and we've heard fewer rumors about any imminent tablet launches.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

Voices",
        "Body": "CNN —\n\nBritain’s Conservative Party will introduce mandatory national service for 18-year-olds if it wins the national election on July 4, comprising military or community participation, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Sunday.\n\nYoung adults will be able to choose between spending one weekend a month volunteering over the course of a year, or take up one of 30,000 spaces to spend a year in the armed forces, Sunak said.\n\nThe announcement followed Labour Party leader Keir Starmer’s comments on Saturday that he was in favour of allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote.\n\nSunak’s Conservatives lag Labour by a wide margin in opinion polls, which have shown little change in fortunes for the prime minister since his surprise election call last Wednesday.\n\n“Britain today faces a future that is more dangerous and more divided. There’s no doubt that our democratic values are under threat. That is why we will introduce a bold new model of national service for 18-year-olds,” Sunak said in a statement.\n\nThe Conservative Party said the proposal would be funded by cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion, and by diverting money from the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, which existed to reduce regional economic inequality.\n\nLabour politicians derided the announcement.\n\n“The national service we need from our young people is to vote for change on July 4,” said Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester.\n\nInterior minister James Cleverly told broadcasters there would be no criminal sanctions for skipping mandatory service but that people will be compelled to do it, without providing further details.\n\nAsked by the BBC if forcing adults to volunteer was at odds with the Conservative Party’s liberal tradition, Cleverly said: “We force people to do things all the time.”\n\nHe cited compulsory education or training for teenagers until the age of 18 as an example.",

        "Body": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nSPEEDWAY, Indiana -- It thundered. It rained. It rocked. Precisely four hours after the green flag was meant to wave over the field of 33 drivers at the 108th Indianapolis 500, an instant classic was authored from the opening lap as a record-setting 18 leaders spent time up front in the spotlight over the 200-lap thriller.\n\nDelayed by a menacing storm, the dinnertime Indy 500 saw the checkered wave as 8 p.m. ET approached, and in those long evening shadows, more than 300,000 spent and weary fans stayed and took stock of the unhinged action that turned a beloved race into an adrenaline-depleting affair.\n\nCrashes, blown engines, rampant aggression -- including multiple 200-mph trips into the grass -- ruled the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Three drivers failed to make it through the first corner on the opening lap. Honda motors trailed smoke and stranded three more. Veterans Marco Andretti, Colton Herta, and Will Power also smacked the walls as general mayhem meant 47 laps were burned behind the safety car across eight caution periods.\n\nAnd after each instance of madness was cleaned up, the restarts where were indelible memories were made. Fanning four wide or wider into Turn 1 drew as many cheers as gasps; the risks taken by champions and rookies alike were shocking. It was a gift to the throngs of fans who waited through the long delays.\n\nMexico's Pato O'Ward, IndyCar's most popular driver, commanded the loudest roar as he took the lead in the closing moments, and as more wild swings of fortune were revealed, he was left a tearful, crestfallen mess as his lead was surrendered with two turns left to complete. There's no taste more bitter in motor racing than the one experienced by the 500's first loser.\n\nO'Ward, his eyes red from another runner-up result at Indy, was nearly inconsolable. A life so nearly changed in perpetuity, felled by a 0.3417-second deficit at the finish line.\n\nJosef Newgarden won his second straight Indianapolis 500 on Sunday, a feat that hasn't been accomplished since 2002. Alex Martin / Journal and Courier / USA TODAY NETWORK\n\n\"It's been a tough month,\" O'Ward said after matching the second place he earned at Indy in 2022. \"So much goes into this race. I'm somebody that wears my heart on my sleeve. I don't really hide anything. It's just when you've come so close and it just doesn't seem to -- you just can't seem to get it right, it's just a lot of emotion.\"\n\nIn the end, the team that swept the front row in qualifying ultimately led 90 laps and fired defending winner Josef Newgarden of Tennessee back into victory lane to make him the first back-to-back winner since 2002.\n\nAn astonishingly brave pass around O'Ward in Turn 3 -- one that normally leads to a calamitous outcome -- held and Newgarden sealed his second consecutive Indy triumph in a span of 12 months. The last to do it was one of his mentors, four-time Indy winner Helio Castroneves.\n\nWith the sun fading over the vast grandstands, Newgarden's greatness at the coliseum that made Andretti's and Foyt's and Unser's was confirmed. He'll need more IndyCar championships and at least one additional 500 win to cement his status as an all-timer, but that quest -- one that's realistic -- officially sparked to life May 26, 2024.\n\n\"I had let go of the thought of winning this race last year,\" Newgarden told ESPN. \"It's so difficult to win. There are no guarantees. It doesn't matter how good you are or how well you execute. It does not guarantee a victory at Indianapolis ever. Last year I really started focusing on just the opportunity and saying, you know, this is so fun that we get to show up here and we've got great cars, we've got a great crew and we have an opportunity to win the race. I know we did last year, and I definitely know we did this year.\n\n\"I focused on that. I said if we win it, that's great, but it's the opportunity that's the joy of it. I say that because it is very difficult to win the race. It's very difficult to win it back to back. I'm over the moon. I've got no words for what we've been able to do.\"\n\nEverything Newgarden does going forward is about legacy, which fans at the largest single-day sporting event in the world bore witness to in central Indiana. It was a day they won't forget.",

        "Body": "There was no warning, no motive, and the man just laughed as he attacked, according to Dembowski, wounding them before the two oldest girls chased him away. They’re physically fine, she said, but deeply shaken.\n\nBut a peaceful evening on the South Shore was shattered Saturday after a man armed with a knife entered the AMC Braintree 10 around 6 p.m., approached the group from behind their seats, and attacked the girls, including Dembowski’s twin 9-year-olds and her 17-year-old daughter.\n\nSaturday was supposed to be a joyful summer night at the movies for Lisa Dembowski’s three daughters and their friend — concessions in their hands, and a whole theater to themselves to watch the John Krasinski film “If.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I think they are terrified that they could just go to a movie on a Saturday night, and this could happen — someone could just walk into a movie theater and do this,” Dembowski said.\n\nThe attacks on the four girls were part of a violent night in the region Saturday, as authorities said a Chilmark man stabbed two McDonald’s workers in Plymouth, then crashed his Porsche while trying to flee State Police in Sandwich.\n\nAuthorities have arrested Jared Ravizza, 26, who faces a slew of charges, including assault with intent to murder, in connection with the restaurant attack, and is due to be arraigned Tuesday at Plymouth District Court, according to Plymouth District Attorney Timothy J. Cruz.\n\nState Police and Braintree police each have said the crimes in Braintree and Plymouth appear connected; two law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation confirmed to the Globe Sunday that Ravizza is being investigated for the theater attack.\n\nRavizza was previously arrested in April by West Tisbury police on Martha’s Vineyard and charged with assault and battery on a family or household member, along with vandalism, after he allegedly attacked his father, according to records at Edgartown District Court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a police report on file with the court, Ravizza’s father told officers that Ravizza “had just had a mental break and attacked him” inside his home, and the father suffered marks to his face, thumb, and wrist, according to police. Ravizza also wrecked his father’s home office, the report said.\n\nHe was sent to Martha’s Vineyard Hospital for a mental health evaluation, but Ravizza “did not meet their standards to be held,″ the report said. According to court records, the Edgartown case was directed to pretrial diversion, with a session scheduled for November.\n\nOn Sunday, the investigation into the stabbing attacks remained ongoing, but there was no sign that Ravizza knew any of his alleged victims. In Plymouth, the attack occurred following a pay dispute, officials have said.\n\nPolice arrested Jared Ravizza, a 26-year-old resident of Chilmark identified by Massachusetts authorities as the man accused of stabbing two McDonald's employees who work at a restaurant at a Plymouth rest area. Photo by David Curran\n\nDembowski told a pool reporter Sunday that she has no idea who attacked her daughters and their friend at the Braintree theater, or why.\n\n“I hope he gets what he deserves. I mean, I understand mental health, I’m a counselor. ... I think it’s a pretty sick individual to harm children,” Dembowski said.\n\nHer oldest daughter suffered an injury to her back, another was wounded in the top of her chest, and the other twin was cut across her arm, according to Dembowski. She said AMC employees didn’t believe the girls when they said they’d been stabbed, and her 17-year-old had to call police.\n\nA worker at the theater directed a reporter to an AMC media hotline Sunday. The company did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe girls were taken to Boston Medical Center “due to the nature of the wounds,” she said.\n\nDembowski said she was proud of her eldest daughter’s cool-headedness during the attack.\n\n“I give her an enormous amount of credit, because in my mind ... her and her friend kept the two little ones completely calm,” Dembowski said.\n\nDembowski praised the work of police and EMTs who responded to the scene following the attack: “They were so empathetic and so kind,” she said. Hospital staffers who treated the four girls also helped keep them calm, she said.\n\nShe remains frustrated that her children and their friend were victims of violence.\n\n“It makes parents sick to bring their kids anywhere or let them go anywhere without them,” she said.\n\nAfter the attack in Braintree, the assailant fled in a black SUV, authorities have said.\n\nAbout an hour later, in Plymouth, police received multiple 911 calls reporting that two workers inside the McDonald’s at the Route 3 rest area had been stabbed around 7 p.m. Both workers were hospitalized for knife lacerations, according to Cruz.\n\nInvestigators reviewed surveillance video from the restaurant and said it appears to show Ravizza “allegedly reach through the drive-thru window and stab the male victim with a large knife,” the statement said.\n\nMcDonald’s did not respond to a request for comment Sunday.\n\nRavizza left the drive-thru in an SUV, parked the car, entered the McDonald’s, and stabbed the woman, according to Cruz. He then returned to his car and fled the area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA witness at the McDonald’s reported the plate registration on Ravizza’s black 2018 Porsche Macan to Massachusetts State Police, and it was determined the vehicle was registered to him, Cruz’s statement said.\n\nState Police tried to pull Ravizza’s Porsche over, but he didn’t stop, and the vehicle crashed a short time later, officials have said.\n\nHe was arrested in Sandwich at about 7:15 p.m. by State Police and local police on Cotuit Road near the intersection of Asa Meiggs Road, according to Sandwich Police Chief Jason Keene. Ravizza was taken to South Shore Hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries, according to Cruz. Ravizza remained at the hospital Sunday.\n\nPolice arrested Jared Ravizza after a car crash in Sandwich. Photo by David Curran\n\nMassachusetts authorities have also learned that an alert to law enforcement agencies had been issued for Ravizza’s arrest because of “other incidents,” Cruz’s statement said.\n\nState Police in Connecticut reported a fatal stabbing that ended with a suspect being taken into custody by Massachusetts State Police on Saturday. Authorities in Connecticut or Massachusetts haven’t confirmed whether Ravizza was a suspect in that case.\n\nThe victim in the Connecticut stabbing was found dead at “an address” in Deep River, Conn., after police responded to a report of a disturbance there at 3:36 p.m. Saturday, Connecticut State Police said.\n\nThe victim’s identity was not confirmed Sunday.\n\n“A suspect in this investigation has been taken into custody in the State of Massachusetts and there is no active threat to the public,” Connecticut State Police said in a brief statement. They referred additional questions about any connection to the Massachusetts State Police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Massachusetts State Police spokesperson would not confirm a connection between Ravizza and the Connecticut death Sunday.\n\nMike Bello and Nick Stoico of the Globe staff contributed to this report\n\nJohn Hilliard can be reached at john.hilliard@globe.com.

        "Body": "The Minnesota Timberwolves won’t win many games with Anthony Edwards and Anthony Karl-Anthony Towns shooting a combined 28.6% from the field in the first half of a Western Conference finals game.\n\nThe Timberwolves also won’t win many series with Edwards and Towns shooting a combined 33% from the field through three games.\n\nThat’s the situation in the West finals where the Dallas Mavericks took complete control of the series, beating the Timberwolves, 116-107, in Game 3 Sunday for a 3-0 series lead.\n\nTrailing 104-102 with 5:04 remaining in the fourth quarter, the Mavs outscored the Timberwolves 12-1 for a 113-105 lead with 34.8 seconds to play.\n\nNo team in 154 scenarios has come back from a 3-0 deficit in the NBA playoffs and won a series.\n\nThe Mavs can complete a stunning sweep in Game 4 on Tuesday in Dallas (8:30 p.m. ET, TNT). In the East, Boston has a 3-0 series lead against Indiana, and the NBA Finals is headed for a Celtics-Mavericks showdown.\n\nThe Timberwolves that finished off Denver in the conference semifinals do not look like the same team on the edge of elimination against Dallas.\n\nA combination of the Mavs and inexperience this deep in the playoffs have overwhelmed the Timberwolves, and they have been unable to stop Dallas stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.\n\nDoncic had his third 30-point game of the series, compiling 33 points, seven rebounds and five assists, and Irving, who is enjoying a basketball revival with Dallas, scored 14 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter. Doncic and Irving become the first backcourt to each score at least 30 points in the same game three times in the playoffs in the past 50 years.\n\n“It is the most talented backcourt in the history of the NBA,” TNT analyst Stan Van Gundy said.\n\nSaid Mavs coach Jason Kidd: \"There's a lot of trust when you talk about Ky and Luka. ... Those two guys are winners. They want to win. They want to help the team. ... My job is to inform them of what I see and try to put those guys in position to be successful.\"\n\nIn the final five minutes of the fourth quarter, the Timberwolves missed eight of nine shots, including four 3-point attempts. \"Terrible offense down the stretch. Bad shots. Turnovers. No composure,\" Minnesota coach Chris Finch said.\n\nEdwards had 26 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, and Towns finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds. But they were a combined 16-for-42 (38.1%) from the field and 0-for-10 on 3-pointers.\n\nOf concern to the Mavs is the health of rookie center Dereck Lively II, who took an inadvertent Karl-Anthony Towns knee to the head with 8:35 left in the second quarter. He did not return with what the team called a strained neck. Lively, the No. 12 pick in the 2023 draft and an all-rookie honoree, is 13-for-13 from the field in the conference finals, and the Timberwolves took advantage of his absence.",

VoicesI feared losing my children over postnatal depression  BBC.comTalking about mental health for mothers  WGHP FOX8 GreensboroAccess to Perinatal Mental Healthcare: What Exactly Are The Obstacles?  MDedge",
        "Body": "The first pill for postpartum depression is finally getting to patients. Doctors say it’s working.\n\nIt was supposed to be an exciting time. The new mother had just given birth at age 42, after a much-desired pregnancy. But within a week, she developed postpartum depression.\n\nThe medical condition — characterized by extreme sadness, anxiety or despair following childbirth — affects up to 1 in 5 women.\n\nAt five months postpartum, the woman was stuck in a haze, said Dr. Misty Richards, medical director of perinatal psychiatry at the Maternal Outpatient Mental Health Services Clinic at UCLA Health, who treated the patient and described her experience to NBC News.\n\n“She wasn’t taking showers. She wasn’t eating,” Richards said, adding that the woman’s husband had taken a leave of absence from work to care for his wife and new baby.\n\nRichards’ clinic has treated hundreds of these patients. At first, she connected the woman to an intensive outpatient program, but even while attending, the patient was actively suicidal, Richards said.\n\nThat’s when Richards prescribed zuranolone — the first-ever pill to treat postpartum depression.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved the drug in August, but it took months for supply to become available. Several psychiatrists said they’re just starting to write their first prescriptions, since it has taken time to find good candidates for the drug who are willing to take it. They hope it will be a game changer because it’s fast-acting and can be taken at home.\n\nRichards said the woman who took zuranolone, the first of her patients so far, saw her depression symptoms start to resolve around three days in. The patient was seeing dramatic results as of day eight and didn’t experience any side effects.\n\n“She tells me she feels like she just woke up,” Richards said, adding: “I truly feel like I’m meeting her for the first time. Her husband was in tears, super grateful. Just a major, grand slam success story — which, by the way, we don’t tend to see in psychiatry.”\n\nPostpartum depression can have severe consequences for mothers and their children. For moms, it may increase the risk of suicide, high blood pressure, diabetes or stroke. Mental illness, suicide and drug overdoses are the leading causes of death in the first year after a woman gives birth. Children born to mothers with postpartum depression, meanwhile, are more likely to have developmental delays and emotional or behavioral problems, and have a greater risk of dying before one year.\n\nBefore zuranolone, the only available treatment was an intravenous injection approved in 2019. But it comes with a risk of excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness, so only certain treatment centers are allowed to administer it and patients must stay in the hospital for 2 1/2 days. Other women with the condition are given standard antidepressants, but those usually take weeks to start working. (Zuranolone can be taken alongside widely used antidepressants).\n\nThe FDA fast-tracked zuranolone in 2017 — a step taken for drugs that could treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. In a pair of clinical trials, it was shown to improve symptoms of severe postpartum depression — such as anxiety, difficulty sleeping, loss of pleasure, low energy, guilt or social withdrawal — as early as three days in. The pills are taken daily for two weeks, in the evening with a fatty meal.\n\nThe medication isn’t ideal for mild postpartum depression, or the “baby blues,” doctors said. Instead, they’re considering it for patients who have a hard time caring for themselves or their babies — in other words, those for whom medical intervention could be lifesaving.\n\nChallenges in prescribing the new pill\n\nDespite the potential benefits of zurnalone, psychiatrists said some patients are hesitant to take a drug that’s new to the market, wary of side effects or concerned about practical barriers.\n\nZuranolone can cause drowsiness, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue and urinary tract infections. So far, doctors said they’ve heard of patients experiencing drowsiness or dizziness, but not to an extreme degree.\n\nBecause of this effect, however, the medication comes with a warning not to drive or operate heavy machinery for at least 12 hours after taking it.\n\nDr. Uruj Haider, medical director of consultation services at the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Program for Moms, said some patients have expressed concern that they’ll be too tired to feed their babies at night. She recommends that patients have another caretaker in the house overnight.\n\n“If they have toddlers and they don’t have someone at home to watch the baby or other children at night, that can be very challenging to be on a medication that can make you feel very drowsy,” she said.\n\nOther patients have declined the medication due to a lack of safety data on breastfeeding, Haider added. A small amount of zuranolone can pass from mother to child through breast milk, but studies haven’t evaluated if it poses any harm.\n\nRichards said she recommends that new moms discard their breast milk while taking zuranolone.\n\nBut Dr. Julia Frew, a psychiatrist at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, said she suspects that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the risk of medication exposure, particularly since the transfer of other antidepressants through breast milk hasn’t been shown to pose a significant risk.\n\n“I think it could be a very reasonable choice for someone to continue breastfeeding while they’re taking it,” she said. “Some people may be uncomfortable with that, and they may want to choose to pump and dump.”\n\nAdditionally, zuranolone is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance — in the same class as Xanax — meaning there’s a low risk of addiction.\n\n“I don’t think we really know the addictive potential. There’s hope that it’s not addictive,” said Dr. Katrina Furey, a clinical instructor in the Yale School of Medicine’s psychiatry department.\n\nPatients report improvements\n\nHaider said one of her patients has completed a 14-day course of zuranolone, and the woman’s symptoms started to improve by day four.\n\n“The only side effect was the drowsiness at night, and that was gone by the morning,” she said. The woman welcomed the drowsiness, Haider added, since it helped her sleep.\n\nFrew similarly said she has had one patient finish zuranolone this year. The woman had chronic depression before her pregnancy, which got significantly worse postpartum. Other medications had failed to treat her symptoms, but zuranolone offered some relief, she said.\n\nBut it’s not yet known whether zuranolone has a lasting effect. In trials, patients saw a benefit for up to four weeks, but the studies didn’t follow people for longer than that.\n\n“We don’t know yet if people are going to need booster doses down the road,” Furey said.\n\nA ‘cumbersome, clunky’ insurance process\n\nSome psychiatrists said they’ve struggled with the process of getting zuranolone approved by insurance companies.\n\nThe medication must go through one of five specialty pharmacies and be delivered to patients by mail.\n\n“You cannot pick up zuranolone from your local CVS,” Haider said.\n\nInsurance companies also have varying requirements about how severe patients’ symptoms need to be to get zuranolone covered. Some insurers require people to have tried and failed a standard antidepressant first.\n\n“It’s a cumbersome, clunky process,” Richards said, adding that many patients don’t have time to wait for the kinks to iron out or actively manage their deliveries.\n\n“If someone is severely depressed — and that is the reason you would be prescribing zuranolone instead of anything else — asking them to kind of wait for this process and then to engage in this process, it is hard,” she added.\n\nNevertheless, psychiatrists said they’re eager to recommend the drug to patients.\n\n“I’ve started telling all my patients about it,” Furey said. “Just so they know it’s available and they know that there is this new option.”\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

        "Body": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nGliese 12 b's estimated size may be as large as Earth or slightly smaller—comparable to Venus in our solar system. This artist's concept compares Earth with different possible Gliese 12 b interpretations, from one with no atmosphere to one with a thick Venus-like one. Follow-up observations with NASA's James Webb Space Telescope could help determine just how much atmosphere the planet retains as well as its composition. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt (Caltech-IPAC)\n\nUsing observations by NASA's TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) and many other facilities, two international teams of astronomers have discovered a planet between the sizes of Earth and Venus only 40 light-years away. Multiple factors make it a candidate well-suited for further study using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nTESS stares at a large swath of the sky for about a month at a time, tracking the brightness changes of tens of thousands of stars at intervals ranging from 20 seconds to 30 minutes. Capturing transits—brief, regular dimmings of stars caused by the passage of orbiting worlds—is one of the mission's primary goals.\n\n\"We've found the nearest, transiting, temperate, Earth-size world located to date,\" said Masayuki Kuzuhara, a project assistant professor at the Astrobiology Center in Tokyo, who co-led one research team with Akihiko Fukui, a project assistant professor at the University of Tokyo. \"Although we don't yet know whether it possesses an atmosphere, we've been thinking of it as an exo-Venus, with similar size and energy received from its star as our planetary neighbor in the solar system.\"\n\nThe host star, called Gliese 12, is a cool red dwarf located almost 40 light-years away in the constellation Pisces. The star is only about 27% of the sun's size, with about 60% of the sun's surface temperature. The newly discovered world, named Gliese 12 b, orbits every 12.8 days and is Earth's size or slightly smaller—comparable to Venus. Assuming it has no atmosphere, the planet has a surface temperature estimated at around 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius).\n\nIn this sequence, the camera starts close to a Venus-like artist's concept of Gliese 12 b set against a starry background. As the camera pulls back and spins, the planet shrinks, the stars whirl, and the planet's host star eventually appears. The planet passes across the star's face, creating a transit. Passing through the planet's atmosphere, the host star's light is partly absorbed, encoding into it the chemical fingerprints of the atmosphere's component elements. Gliese 12 b is one of the best candidates for this type of study. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt (Caltech-IPAC)\n\nAstronomers say that the diminutive sizes and masses of red dwarf stars make them ideal for finding Earth-size planets. A smaller star means greater dimming for each transit, and a lower mass means an orbiting planet can produce a greater wobble, known as \"reflex motion,\" of the star. These effects make smaller planets easier to detect.\n\nThe lower luminosities of red dwarf stars also means their habitable zones—the range of orbital distances where liquid water could exist on a planet's surface—lie closer to them. This makes it easier to detect transiting planets within habitable zones around red dwarfs than those around stars emitting more energy.\n\nThe distance separating Gliese 12 and the new planet is just 7% of the distance between Earth and the sun. The planet receives 1.6 times more energy from its star as Earth does from the sun and about 85% of what Venus experiences.\n\nSame as above but with a thinner atmosphere around Gliese 12 b. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt (Caltech-IPAC)\n\n\"Gliese 12 b represents one of the best targets to study whether Earth-size planets orbiting cool stars can retain their atmospheres, a crucial step to advance our understanding of habitability on planets across our galaxy,\" said Shishir Dholakia, a doctoral student at the Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Southern Queensland in Australia. He co-led a different research team with Larissa Palethorpe, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh and University College London.\n\nBoth teams suggest that studying Gliese 12 b may help unlock some aspects of our own solar system's evolution.\n\n\"It is thought that Earth's and Venus's first atmospheres were stripped away and then replenished by volcanic outgassing and bombardments from residual material in the solar system,\" Palethorpe explained. \"The Earth is habitable, but Venus is not due to its complete loss of water. Because Gliese 12 b is between Earth and Venus in temperature, its atmosphere could teach us a lot about the habitability pathways planets take as they develop.\"\n\nSame as above but with an airless version of Gliese 12 b. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt (Caltech-IPAC)\n\nOne important factor in retaining an atmosphere is the storminess of its star. Red dwarfs tend to be magnetically active, resulting in frequent, powerful X-ray flares. However, analyses by both teams conclude that Gliese 12 shows no signs of extreme behavior.\n\nA paper led by Kuzuhara and Fukui appears in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. The Dholakia and Palethorpe findings were published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society on the same day.\n\nDuring a transit, the host star's light passes through any atmosphere. Different gas molecules absorb different colors, so the transit provides a set of chemical fingerprints that can be detected by telescopes like Webb.\n\n\"We know of only a handful of temperate planets similar to Earth that are both close enough to us and meet other criteria needed for this kind of study, called transmission spectroscopy, using current facilities,\" said Michael McElwain, a research astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and a co-author of the Kuzuhara and Fukui paper. \"To better understand the diversity of atmospheres and evolutionary outcomes for these planets, we need more examples like Gliese 12 b.\"\n\nTESS is a NASA Astrophysics Explorer mission managed by NASA Goddard and operated by MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Additional partners include Northrop Grumman, based in Falls Church, Virginia; NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley; the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian in Cambridge, Massachusetts; MIT's Lincoln Laboratory; and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.

        "Body": "The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry raised the death toll to 45 Monday from Israeli airstrikes in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, AFP and Reuters reported. Gaza officials said the strike hit tents for displaced people in Rafah, with \"numerous\" others trapped in flaming debris.\n\nThe airstrike came hours after Hamas claimed it fired a barrage of rockets from Gaza toward central Israel as rocket sirens rang for the first time in months in cities like Tel Aviv.\n\nThe Israeli attack drew swift condemnation from Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Turkey, France and Qatar which warned it could \"hinder\" budding steps to revive stalled truce and hostage release talks in the Israel-Hamas war raging since October 7, AFP noted.\n\nGaza's Ministry of Health said in an earlier statement that, \"Never before in history has such a large number of mass killing tools been amassed and employed together in front of the world as is happening now in Gaza,\" noting severe shortages of water, food, medicine, electricity and fuel.\n\nEyewitnesses told CBS News' team in Gaza that eight airstrikes hit tents in western Rafah, though the reports could not be independently confirmed. The eyewitnesses said the casualties, which included civilians, were rushed to Emirati Hospital. The tents were part of a camp about 200 meters (about 650 feet) away from the largest United Nations warehouse in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces acknowledged the strike in a statement Sunday night.\n\n\"A short while ago, an IDF aircraft struck a Hamas compound in Rafah in which significant Hamas terrorists were operating,\" the IDF said. \"The strike was carried out against legitimate targets under international law, using through the use of precise munitions and on the basis of precise intelligence that indicated Hamas' use of the area. The IDF is aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review.\"\n\nFootage from the scene showed heavy destruction, and a spokesperson with the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said the death toll was likely to increase as search and rescue efforts continued in Rafah's Tal al-Sultan neighborhood west of the city center.\n\nThe society asserted that the location had been designated by Israel as a \"humanitarian area.\"\n\nA Palestinian boy rides a bicycle past a destroyed building in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on May 26, 2024. EYAD BABA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe strike comes two days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to end its military offensive in Rafah.\n\nIsrael's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, was in Rafah on Sunday and was briefed on the \"deepening of operations\" there, his office said.\n\nIn a statement on its Telegram channel Sunday, al-Qassam Brigades said the rockets fired by Hamas were launched in response to what it called \"Zionist massacres against civilians,\" Reuters reported.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said its air defenses intercepted several projectiles after eight rockets were launched from Rafah in the Gaza Strip toward Israel.\n\nThe militants have fired projectiles at communities around Gaza during the war, but have not fired longer-range rockets in months.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from what appeared to be the first long-range rocket attack from Gaza since January, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe escalation came hours after aid trucks entered Gaza from southern Israel through a new agreement to bypass the Rafah crossing with Egypt. Israeli forces seized the southern city of Rafah earlier this month. It was unclear if humanitarian groups would be able to access the aid because of the ongoing fighting in the area.\n\nEgypt refuses to reopen its side of the Rafah crossing until control of the Gaza side is handed back to Palestinians. It agreed to temporarily divert traffic through Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing, Gaza's main cargo terminal, after a call between U.S. President Joe Biden and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.\n\nIsraeli military vehicles drive in the Gaza Strip as seen from southern Israel, Friday, May 24, 2024. Tsafrir Abayov / AP\n\nThe war between Israel and Hamas, now in its eighth month, has killed nearly 36,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials. Around 80% of the population's 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.\n\nHamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which its militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas is still holding some 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year.\n\nOn Saturday, CBS News reported that U.S. diplomatic efforts to broker a deal to release hostages held in Gaza by Hamas are expected to continue in the coming week. Negotiators from Qatar, Egypt and the United States will be part of the talks.\n\n\"There is progress,\" a senior Biden administration official told CBS News. \"Contacts are ongoing and we are working closely with Egyptian and Qatari mediators. These contacts will continue through the coming week as we seek to move the negotiating process forward.\"",

        "Body": "Six people who shared a meal involving black bear meat kebabs have been diagnosed with trichinellosis, a parasitic zoonotic disease.\n\nIn a new report released this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed that in July 2022, a 29-year old hospitalized patient with suspected trichinellosis was reported to the Minnesota health department. His symptoms included fever, severe muscle aches, periorbital edema or eye swelling, and eosinophilia or the condition of elevated levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell.\n\nAccording to the report, a week prior to the symptoms appearing, the patient and eight other people shared a meal that included the meat of a black bear which had been frozen for 45 days before being grilled and served rare with vegetables that had been cooked with the meat.\n\nAn investigation into the incident found six trichinellosis cases, including two in people who consumed only the vegetables. Trichinellosis is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of trichinella, a type of roundworm. Typically, meat contaminated with the trichinella larvae comes from meat-eating animals such as bears, wild boars or walruses.\n\nMolecular testing found that larvae from the bear meat had been frozen in a household freezer for more than 15 weeks and that the larvae was trichinella nativa, a freeze-resistant species. The CDC warns that adequate cooking is the only reliable way to kill trichinella parasites and that infected meat can cross-contaminate other foods.\n\nThe CDC reports that six days before the symptom onset in the initial patient, he and eight extended family members from Arizona, Minnesota and South Dakota gathered in South Dakota for several days. During their gathering, they ate the meat from a black bear which had been harvested by one of the family members in northern Saskatchewan, Canada, in May 2022.\n\nAccording to the report, the meat was “initially inadvertently served rare, reportedly because the meat was dark in color, and it was difficult for the family members to visually ascertain the level of doneness”.\n\nIt added: “After some of the family members began eating the meat and noticed that it was undercooked, the meat was recooked before being served again.”\n\nThree of the six symptomatic people, two of whom sought care at least twice before being offered treatment, were hospitalized. All three patients received trichinellosis-directed treatment with albendazole, a medication for the treatment of a variety of parasitic worm infections.\n\nAll six symptomatic people recovered, with the CDC reporting that the non-hospitalized patients did not receive trichinellosis-directed treatment because their symptoms had resolved with supportive care only.\n\nAcross the US, trichinellosis is rarely reported. Most of the cases that are reported relate to the consumption of meat from wild game.\n\nFrom January 2016 to December 2022, there were seven trichinellosis outbreaks in the US that were reported to the CDC, including 35 probable and confirmed cases. Bear meat was the suspected or confirmed source of infection for the majority of these outbreaks, the CDC said.",

When teammate Marcell Ozuna was up to bat, Acuña tried to steal third base, but his leg buckled awkwardly. He was helped off the field and the team described his injury as “left knee soreness.”\n\n“I saw the catcher throwing the ball back to the pitcher very slow. I was timing that so I could steal third,” Acuña said, per MLB.com. “But in that moment, he threw it hard.

VoicesRescuers Search for 670 Missing in Papua New Guinea Disaster  BloombergAt least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face  The Hill",
        "Body": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A Papua New Guinea government official has told the United Nations more than 2,000 people were believed to have been buried alive by Friday’s landslide and has formally asked for international help.\n\nThe government figure is roughly triple the U.N. estimate of 670 killed by the landslide in the South Pacific island nation’s mountainous interior. The remains of only six people had been recovered so far.\n\nIn a letter seen by The Associated Press to the United Nations resident coordinator dated Sunday, the acting director of the South Pacific island nation’s National Disaster Center Luseta Laso Mana said the landslide “buried more than 2000 people alive” and caused “major destruction” at Yambali village in the Enga province.\n\nEstimates of the casualties have varied widely since the disaster occurred, and it was not immediately clear how officials arrived the number of people affected.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration, which is working closely with the government and taking a leading role in the international response, has not changed its estimated death toll of 670 released on Sunday, pending new evidence.\n\n“We are not able to dispute what the government suggests but we are not able to comment on it,” said Serhan Aktoprak, the chief of the U.N. migrant agency’s mission in Papua New Guinea.\n\n“As time goes in such a massive undertaking, the number will remain fluid,” Aktoprak added.\n\nThe death toll of 670 was based on calculations by Yambali village and Enga provicincial officials that more than 150 homes had been buried by the landslide. The previous estimate had been 60 homes.\n\nThe office of Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape did not respond Monday to a request for an explanation of what the government estimate of 2,000 was based on. Marape has promised to release information about the scale of the destruction and loss of life when it becomes available.\n\nDetermining the scale of the disaster is difficult because of challenging conditions on the ground including the village’s remote location, a lack of telecommunications and tribal warfare throughout the province which means international relief workers and aid convoys require military escorts.\n\nAt least 26 tribal warriors and mercenaries were killed in a battle between two warring tribes in Enga in February, as well as an unconfirmed number of bystanders.\n\nThe national government’s lack of reliable census data also adds to the challenges of determining how many are potentially dead.\n\nThe government estimates Papua New Guinea’s population at around 10 million people, although a U.N. study, based on data including satellite photographs of roof tops, estimated in 2022 it could be as high as 17 million. An accurate census has not been held in the nation in decades.\n\nThe landslide had also buried a 200-meter (650-foot) stretch of the province’s main highway under debris 6 to 8 meters (20 to 26 feet) deep which creates a major obstacle to relief workers.\n\nMana said the landslide would have a major economic impact on the entire country.\n\n“The situation remains unstable” due to the shifting ground, “posing ongoing danger to both the rescue teams and survivors alike,” Mana wrote to the United Nations.\n\nAn excavator donated by a local builder Sunday became the first piece of heavy earth-moving machinery brought in to help villagers who have been digging with shovels and farming tools to find bodies. Working around the still-shifting debris is treacherous.\n\nMana and Papua New Guinea’s defense minister, Billy Joseph, flew on Sunday in an Australian military helicopter from the capital of Port Moresby to Yambali, 600 kilometers (370 miles) to the northwest, to gain a firsthand perspective of what is needed.\n\nMana’s office posted a photo of him at Yambali handing a local official a check for 500,000 kina ($130,000) to buy emergency supplies for the 4,000 displaced survivors.\n\nThe purpose of the visit was to decide whether Papua New Guinea’s government needed to officially request more international support.\n\nEarth-moving equipment used by Papua New Guinea’s military was being transported to the disaster scene 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the east coast city of Lae.\n\nTraumatized villagers are divided over whether heavy machinery should be allowed to dig up and potentially further damage the bodies of their buried relatives, officials said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalist Adam Schreck in Bangkok contributed to this report.",

In April, the company released the new Grok 1.5 model and also allowed Premium users on X to access the chatbot. Additionally, the Musk-owned company previewed Grok’s multimodal capabilities in April. Earlier this year, the company open-sourced the Grok model but without any training code.\n\nxAI plans to deploy the funds from the new financing round to take its first set of products to market, build advanced infrastructure, and accelerate the research and development of future technologies, it said in the blog post. The company is likely to look for partnerships to introduce Grok to users beyond X.\n\nThe company claims that it aims to develop “truthful” AI systems.

Google's AI tool is producing misleading responses that have experts worried  ABC News",
        "Body": "Google has rolled out its latest experimental search feature on Chrome, Firefox and the Google app browser to hundreds of millions of users. “AI Overviews” saves you clicking on links by using generative AI — the same technology that powers rival product ChatGPT — to provide summaries of the search results. Ask “how to keep bananas fresh for longer” and it uses AI to generate a useful summary of tips such as storing them in a cool, dark place and away from other fruits like apples.\n\nBut ask it a left-field question and the results can be disastrous, or even dangerous. Google is currently scrambling to fix these problems one by one, but it is a PR disaster for the search giant and a challenging game of whack-a-mole.\n\nGoogle / The Conversation\n\nAI Overviews helpfully tells you that “Whack-A-Mole is a classic arcade game where players use a mallet to hit moles that pop up at random for points. The game was invented in Japan in 1975 by the amusement manufacturer TOGO and was originally called Mogura Taiji or Mogura Tataki.”\n\nBut AI Overviews also tells you that “astronauts have met cats on the moon, played with them, and provided care”. More worryingly, it also recommends “you should eat at least one small rock per day” as “rocks are a vital source of minerals and vitamins”, and suggests putting glue in pizza topping.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nOne fundamental problem is that generative AI tools don’t know what is true, just what is popular. For example, there aren’t a lot of articles on the web about eating rocks as it is so self-evidently a bad idea.\n\nThere is, however, a well-read satirical article from The Onion about eating rocks. And so Google’s AI based its summary on what was popular, not what was true.\n\nGoogle / The Conversation\n\nAnother problem is that generative AI tools don’t have our values. They’re trained on a large chunk of the web.\n\nAnd while sophisticated techniques (that go by exotic names such as “reinforcement learning from human feedback” or RLHF) are used to eliminate the worst, it is unsurprising they reflect some of the biases, conspiracy theories and worse to be found on the web. Indeed, I am always amazed how polite and well-behaved AI chatbots are, given what they’re trained on.\n\nIs this the future of search?\n\nIf this is really the future of search, then we’re in for a bumpy ride. Google is, of course, playing catch-up with OpenAI and Microsoft.\n\nThe financial incentives to lead the AI race are immense. Google is therefore being less prudent than in the past in pushing the technology out into users’ hands.\n\nIn 2023, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said:\n\nWe’ve been cautious. There are areas where we’ve chosen not to be the first to put a product out. We’ve set up good structures around responsible AI. You will continue to see us take our time.\n\nThat no longer appears to be so true, as Google responds to criticisms that it has become a large and lethargic competitor.\n\nA risky move\n\nIt’s a risky strategy for Google. It risks losing the trust that the public has in Google being the place to find (correct) answers to questions.\n\nBut Google also risks undermining its own billion-dollar business model. If we no longer click on links, just read their summary, how does Google continue to make money?\n\nThe risks are not restricted to Google. I fear such use of AI might be harmful for society more broadly. Truth is already a somewhat contested and fungible idea. AI untruths are likely to make this worse.\n\nIn a decade’s time, we may look back at 2024 as the golden age of the web, when most of it was quality human-generated content, before the bots took over and filled the web with synthetic and increasingly low-quality AI-generated content.\n\nHas AI started breathing its own exhaust?\n\nThe second generation of large language models are likely and unintentionally being trained on some of the outputs of the first generation. And lots of AI startups are touting the benefits of training on synthetic, AI-generated data.\n\nBut training on the exhaust fumes of current AI models risks amplifying even small biases and errors. Just as breathing in exhaust fumes is bad for humans, it is bad for AI.\n\nThese concerns fit into a much bigger picture. Globally, more than US$400 million (A$600 million) is being invested in AI every day. And governments are only now just waking up to the idea we might need guardrails and regulation to ensure AI is used responsibly, given this torrent of investment.\n\nPharmaceutical companies aren’t allowed to release drugs that are harmful. Nor are car companies. But so far, tech companies have largely been allowed to do what they like.",
